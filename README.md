Project Phase 1

The Tiger compiler front-end relies on two parts: the scanner and parser. The scanner performs lexical analysis and passes lexical Tokens to the parser. The parser performs semantic analysis and code generation. The parser also serves as the body of the front-end, calling an instances of the scanner, analyzers, and code generators. The analyzer used by the parser relies on a "symbol table," further explained below.

The symbol table is implemented in a split table fashion, dividing tables between identifiers and types. Firstly,  there is an IdentifierTableList object that creates a new table, an IdentifierTable. When a new scope is entered, the List creates a new Table and links it to the previous. The new scope's table becomes the "head" of the IdentifierTableList. The program using the Table will need to update its pointer to point to the current head. 	

The Identifier Table object is backed by a hashmap of int keys and IdentifierTableEntry values. The IdentifierTableEntry object stores necessary information, such as typeId and name. The IdentifierTable stores new entry objects in the hashmap by creating a hashcode of the entry and using it as the value's key. 

Types are referenced on a TypeTable, which is a hashmap that stores a TypeTableEntry and uses the TypeTableEntry's hashcode as a key.

The back-end is a monolithic implementation of a naive allocation scheme. Data structures exist for each of the Tiger IR's operations and helper functions exist for data allocation. These both serve to help produce MIPS code. 

The back-end's helper functions come from a class called "Allocation." Allocation creates certain enum types (Variable, Temp, and Literal) which correspond to the data types that will be provided by the IR. It contains a function for determining an operand's type, as well as functions for generating code for storing values to memory and loading words into registers, and a function for generating a function specifically handling the MIPS code for loading an address.

All of the back-end components are stored in the same directory.

WORKING COMPONENTS

Scanner - The scanner is isolated as a component within its own package, com.tiger.compiler.scanner. It functions as an iterator, with a next() method that is called repeatedly to return a Token, and eventually returns the End-of-File token repeatedly. It is configured by a csv that encodes a DFA, with current state and character mapping to next state.

Parser - The parser is the largest component currently. Its package, com.tiger.compiler.parser, also contains the Semantic Analysis component. It uses the grammar to iteratively build up and tear down a parse stack using the LL(1) parse algorithm. It is configured by a csv that contains the production number, left side, and right side. The output will be a parse tree, defined by the ParseTreeNode class, upon which semantic actions can be performed.
Output: Every step outputs the full parse stack.

Semantic Analyzer - In its run, the parser may encounter a semantic action (prefixed with # in the grammar csv). In this case it hands over control to the Analyzer. The analyzer utilizes the current state of the parser as well and executes the semantic action as specified in a function. So far we've implemented basic declaration (adding to the symbol table [identifier table]) and assignment (basic type checking). These will depend on the parse tree, which has not yet been fully implemented.
Output: In between two newlines, the name of the current semantic action.

Naive Allocator - This allocation method relies on a limited number of available registers. Data is loaded into the registers and stored onto the stack on an instruction-by-instruction basis. The allocation scheme also takes care of the code generation. The compiler begins with a preprocessing sweep to initialize .word, .data, and .space variables, then performs the rest of the code generation in the .text space on a second sweep. The only IR operations not implemented are "call" and "callr". We chose to leave them unimplemented as the assignment said "We are doing only one function in terms of code generation â€“ the main. No function calls
are to be implemented".

Output: unoptimized MIPS asm code

BUILD & RUN

The front end uses the maven management tool. Follow this guide to install:
https://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/maven-in-five-minutes.html

To build the front end, navigate to the directory "tiger" (within the top-level directory) and use the command

	mvn package

To run, use the command
	
	java -cp target/tiger-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.tiger.compiler.Comp <testfile>

The backend is contained in the "phase2" directory. To compile, use

	javac *.java

To run, use 

	java Compiler <input-file.ir> <output-file.asm>




On the backend, we encountered several inconsistencies within the project specification. As a result, we made a few assumptions, as follows:

1. Function calls are not implemented - though we have skeleton operations for call and callr, they do not generate code. In several of the test files, these 			operations are used but we assumed we did not have to implement them.
	In some of the test cases, there are labels corresponding to functions that take parameters. For example, test2.ir:

	print:
	call, printi, n
	return, , ,
	main:
	call, print, 5
	return, , ,

	Even if we wanted to implement function calls, this IR is incomplete. The 'print' label, which corresponds to the print function defined in test2.tiger, has a parameter n. But a signature for this function is absent from the IR, and thus it would be unclear to the compiler what exactly n refers to. Even if we could assume it's a parameter, what do we do in the case of multiple parameters with different names?

	Additionally, the Example IR in the PDF looks very different:

	void main()
	int-list: A0, B0, C0, D0, E0, var0, var1, var2, var3, var4, var5
	float-list:
	assign, E0, 0,
	assign, D0, 0,
	assign, C0, 0,
	goto, main0
	main0:
	add, A0, 0, var0
	assign, A0, var0,
	...

	Here, there is a completely different operation: void main(). If this is a function signature in the IR, it is missing from all the test cases, and is not specified in the appendix of the same PDF.

2. In the PDF's IR, there are labels int-list and float-list. We assumed these to be labels, as they ended with a colon and were not specified in the appendix. 		However, also not specified in the appendix was the string of variable names following int-list. Our implementation would throw an error if it recieved that 		line.

3. SPIM reserves the label main as the entry point for the system. However, the label in some IR files is preceded by other operations. This leads us to believe 		that label should be changed to one that SPIM does not reserve, and that it should just be encountered in the natural flow of the program. Since label names 		are generated internally to the compiler, it will be fine to reserve the word 'main2' from being used as a label, just as the original 'main', and replace 			'main' with 'main2' when we encounter it. This enables us to keep main as the .globl entry point, and put it the main label at the beginning of generated code.
